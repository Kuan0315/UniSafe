# UniSafe - Campus Safety Companion üõ°Ô∏è

A comprehensive mobile safety application designed for university campuses, providing real-time incident reporting, emergency response features, and location sharing to create safer educational environments.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Track:** Campus Management (Campus Safety App)

**Problem Statement:** Current safety infrastructure often lacks comprehensive coverage, real-time responsiveness, and accessibility features that address the diverse needs of the campus community, leaving gaps in protection and support.

**Solution:** Build a one-stop campus safety mobile application that helps students and staff create a safe study environment that is responsive and meets the diverse needs of a campus community by ensuring the app is accessible to all.
